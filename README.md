# Game Rendering

__I will post the image of the code structure real soon__

## Setting up the project
1. Preferred IDE for this project: Android Studio. (Eclipse works too but Android Studio/IntelliJ doesn't complain lol)
2. Launch Android Studio/IntelliJ
3. Import project
4. Main code to edit is the class `Game` located under the `core` folder. under the package `com.mygdx.game`
5. To adjust the window size, navigate to `DesktopLauncher` class under the  `desktop` folder (We won't be bothering much with this class)
6. Game menu and other relevant screens should go under the package `com.mygdx.game.screens`
7. All of the resources should be stored inside the folder `\android\assets`
